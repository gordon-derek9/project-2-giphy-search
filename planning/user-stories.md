# User Stories – Project 02 (Giphy Search)

1. As a user, I want to type a keyword into a search field and submit it so that I can find GIFs related to my search term.

2. As a user, I want to see the GIF results displayed clearly in a grid layout so that I can browse multiple GIFs easily.

3. As a mobile user, I want the layout to adjust to my screen size so that the site remains readable and usable on small screens.
